          <h2>High Soccer Transfer Fees: A Huge Problem for the "Beautiful Game"</h2>
          <p class="description">This blog talks about how professional soccer across the planet is affected by increasingly high <a href="https://medium.com/@bcpeacock/high-soccer-transfer-fees-a-huge-problem-for-the-beautiful-game-19e362c33c23" target="_blank">transfer</a> fees.
          This is such a big problem because it allows the bigger, wealthier teams, like Real Madrid, Barcelona, 
          Manchester City, and Arsenal, to purchase top end players while other poorer clubs don't have a chance. If a rising club has a star player, chances are 
          a powerhouse team, like the few I mentioned above, will buy that player. </p>

          <h2>The Algorithmic Lens</h2>
          <p class="description">This podcast talks about how <a href="https://soundcloud.com/aditya-singh-671411736/engl-podcast" target="_blank">algorithms</a> in apps affect what people think and believe in.
          In this newly efficient digital world, everyone is glued to their phones. Applications like TikTok, Instagram, and Twitter are so influential
          in a lot of people's lives now due to how much people check social media. What people see on social media is most likely what they will begin to think.
          The algorithms that social media apps use to put posts on users' feeds are the only posts the users will see. This starts to affect people's 
          thoughts, values, and beliefs.</p>

          <h2>Around the World Tutorial</h2><p class="description">This YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLHiuLCfOF0&t=8s" target="_blank">video</a> is a tutorial for people curious about how to perform the "Around the World" soccer juggling trick.
          This was the first soccer juggling trick I learned. If you take 10 or 15 minutes out of your day, I think anyone is able to perform the trick. 
          The "Around the World" trick, once performed, is fun to do. In my opinion, it shows how soccer can bring out so much creativity in someone.</p>

          <h2>Virginia Tech Club Soccer</h2>
          <p class="description">I joined the Virginia Tech Club Soccer <a href="https://vtclubsoccer.weebly.com/" target="_blank">team</a> this semester, 
            and I want to share my experience so far. It has been so much fun to be playing soccer again ever since I stopped playing after high school. 
            Some of the accolades from the season include going undefeated in league play, winning the regional tournament, and coming in second place at the national tournament for 
            the first time in Virginia Tech's Club Soccer history. Overall, spending time with my teammates, traveling to
            different cities, and playing soccer was such an amazing experience.
