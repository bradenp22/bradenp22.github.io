          <h2>Virginia Tech Club Soccer</h2>
          <p class="description">I joined the Virginia Tech Club Soccer <a href="https://vtclubsoccer.weebly.com/" target="_blank">team</a> this semester, and I want to share my experience so far.
            It has been so much fun to be playing soccer again. I say this because ever since I was 3 years old, I have been playing soccer.
            I have traveled to Argentina, Sweden, and England to play the game I love, but my journey came to an end my senior year of high 
            school. Joining the Club Soccer Team has reignited my passion and love for the game. During our fall season, we were able to go
            undefeated in league play, which qualified us for the regional tournament in Richmond, Virginia. We ended up winning the entire tournament 
            qualifying us to play in the national tournament in Austin, Texas. We were able to qualify for the round of 16 by beating Colorado Boulder
            and tying UCLA. We beat Missouri, Rutgers, and Ohio State on our way to Virginia Tech's first national final of its existence. Unfortunately,
            we fell 2-0 to BYU who had won the tournament the previous 4 years in a row. Overall, spending time with my teammates, traveling to
            different cities, and playing soccer was such an amazing experience.
